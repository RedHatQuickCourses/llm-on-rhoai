== Introduction

Modern LLMs can understand and utilize language in a way that has been historically unfathomable to expect from a personal computer. These machine learning models can generate text, summarize content, translate, rewrite, classify, categorize, analyze, and more. All of these abilities provide humans with a powerful toolset to au

In this course, you will learn how to leverage Red Hat OpenShift AI to serve a Large Language Model.

How do we deliver a model to an inference engine, or server, so that, when the server receives a request from any of the applications in the organization's portfolio, the inference engine can reply with a prediction that increases the speed, efficiency and effective of business problem solving.

Machine learning models must be deployed in a production environment to process real-time data and handle the problem they were designed to solve.

In this lab, we going to deploy the Ollama Model framework which operates a bit differently than a standard machine learning model.  Using the Ollama runtime, we can load multiple different models once the runtime is deployed.  These models have been quantitized so they do not require a GPU.  This makes this runtime engine flexible to accomodate the evaluation of mutliple model types. 

WHy is this important, because business aren't implementing a model just for the cool factor.  They are looking to solve a business problem.  However, they often won't know what model will work best to solve that problem, many are still in the experimental phase.  This makes the Ollama framework perfect to evaluate multiple models without needing to reinvent the wheel. 

While this course touches each of the following bullets in the 5 Steps to building an LLM Application graphic, we will primarily focus on the second step, selecting an LLM. Exploring the Ollama Model Runtime.

Ollama is a relatively new but powerful framework designed for serving machine learning models. It's designed to be efficient, scalable, and easy to use, making it an attractive option for developers and organizations looking to deploy their AI models into production
