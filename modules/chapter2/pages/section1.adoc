== Lab: Installation of Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI

IMPORTANT: The installation requires a user with the _cluster-admin_ role

This exercise uses the Red Hat Demo Platform; specifically the OpenShift Container Cluster Platform Resource.  If you haven't already you'll need to launch the lab environment before continuing. 

. Login to the Red Hat OpenShift using a user which has the _cluster-admin_ role assigned.

. Itâ€™s sufficient to install all prerequisite operators with default settings, no additional configuration is necessary.

. Navigate to **Operators** -> **OperatorHub** and search for each of the following Operators individually.  Click on the button or tile for each. In the pop up window that opens, ensure you select the latest version in the *stable* channel and click on **Install** to open the operator's installation view. For this lab you can skip the installation of the optional operators.

[*] You do not have to wait for the previous Operator to complete before installing the next. For this lab you can skip the installation of the optional operators as there is no accelerator required.
// Should this be a note?

    * Red Hat OpenShift Serverless 

    * Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh

    * Red Hat Authorino technical preview

    * GPU Support

    **  Node Feature Discovery Operator (optional)

    **  NVIDIA GPU Operator (optional)


This section will discuss the process for installing the dependent operators using the OpenShift Web Console.

[TIP]
 
 Installing these Operators prior to the installation of the OpenShift AI Operator in my experience has made a difference in OpenShift AI acknowledging the availability of these components and adjusting the initial configuration to shift management of these components to OpenShift AI. 

* Navigate to **Operators** -> **OperatorHub** and search for *OpenShift AI*.

image::openshiftai_operator.png[width=640]

. Click on the `Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI` operator. In the pop up window that opens, ensure you select the latest version in the *stable* channel. Any version greater than 2.10 and click on **Install** to open the operator's installation view.
+

. In the `Install Operator` page, leave all of the options as default and click on the *Install* button to start the installation.

. The operator Installation progress window will pop up. The installation may take a couple of minutes.


WARNING: Do not proceed with the installation past this point.  In order to access the LLM remotely; you will need to make some modifications to the Data Science Cluster YAML file prior to completing the installation of Red Hat OpenShift AI.
