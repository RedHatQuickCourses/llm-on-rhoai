= Installing Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI Using the Web Console

*Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI* is available as an operator via the OpenShift Operator Hub.  You will install the *Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI operator* and dependencies using the OpenShift web console in this section.

== Lab: Installation of Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI

IMPORTANT: The installation requires a user with the _cluster-admin_ role

This exercise uses the Red Hat Demo Platform; specifically the OpenShift Container Cluster Platform Resource.  If you haven't already you'll need to launch the lab environment before continuing. 

. Login to the Red Hat OpenShift using a user which has the _cluster-admin_ role assigned.

. Itâ€™s sufficient to install all prerequisite operators with default settings, no additional configuration is necessary.

. Navigate to **Operators** -> **OperatorHub** and search for each of the following Operators individually.  Click on the button or tile for each. In the pop up window that opens, ensure you select the latest version in the "*specified within instructions*" channel and click on **Install** to open the operator's installation view. For this lab you can skip the installation of the optional operators.

[*] You do not have to wait for the previous Operator to complete before installing the next. For this lab you can skip the installation of the optional operators as there is no accelerator required.
// Should this be a note?

    * Red Hat OpenShift Serverless 

    * Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh

    * Red Hat Authorino technical preview

    * GPU Support

    **  Node Feature Discovery Operator (optional)

. In the `Install Operator` page, leave all of the options as default and click on the *Install* button to start the installation.

. The operator Installation progress window will pop up. The installation may take a couple of minutes.

== Create OpenShift AI Data Science Cluster

The next step is to create an OpenShift AI *Data Science Cluster (DSC)*.

_A DataScienceCluster is the plan in the form of an YAML outline for Data Science Cluster API deployment. Manually editing the YAML configuration can adjust the settings of the OpenShift AI DSC._

Return to the OpenShift Navigation Menu, Select Installed Operators, and click on the OpenShift AI Operator name to open the operator.

 . *Select the option to create a Data Science Cluster.*

 . *Click Create* to deploy the Data Science Cluster.  

This takes ~5 minutes to complete, once the DSC becomes Ready, use the navigation menu at the top right to drop down the menu and select Red Hat OpenShift AI.  Use the same credentials as used log into OpenShift.
